/**
 * Get the current value of an `Observable` as a reactive `Signal`.
 *
 * `fromObservable` returns a `Signal` which provides synchronous reactive access to values produced
 * by the given `Observable`, by subscribing to that `Observable`. The returned `Signal` will always
 * have the most recent value emitted by the subscription, and will throw an error if the
 * `Observable` errors.
 *
 * The subscription will last for the lifetime of the current injection context. That is, if
 * `fromObservable` is called from a component context, the subscription will be cleaned up when the
 * component is destroyed. When called outside of a component, the current `EnvironmentInjector`'s
 * lifetime will be used (which is typically the lifetime of the application itself).
 *
 * If the `Observable` does not produce a value before the `Signal` is read, the `Signal` will throw
 * an error. To avoid this, use a synchronous `Observable` (potentially created with the `startWith`
 * operator) or pass an initial value to `fromObservable` as the second argument.
 *
 * `fromObservable` must be called in an injection context.
